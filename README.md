# Building/Running

On Windows, one can package and run the executable using the `build_windows.py` script (requires `PyInstaller`).

It is adviced to run the following commands after configuring a virtual environment.
Make sure to be in the folder where the main file is located, then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
py MusicPlayer.py
```

You can use the `health_check.py` script to check for unused files in the data folder. Use the `--remove` argument to delete them automatically. The script is also run when the music player starts.

User data is not stored in `AppData` or equivalent, rather in the `data/` folder where the main file is in.

# Hidden Settings

There are 2 settings that can only be accessed in the `data/settings.json` file.

- `"strip_youtube_id"`: Downloaded videos from youtube might have an ID in square brackets at the end of the filename. If this setting is set to `true`, such pattern will be stripped from the display name.
- `taskbar_height`: When this number is different from 0, when the custom titlebar is enabled, it ensures the taskbar is still visible when the window gets maximized. A common value for it is `30`. Only works if the taskbar is at the bottom. A (default) value of 0 will result in fullscreen maximized.

# Dependencies

- `pygame-ce` >= 2.5.1 (music, windowing, input, rendering backend)
- `mili-ui` >= 0.9.7 (UI backend)
- `moviepy` >= 1.0.3 (video/audio converter/reader)
- **[optional]** `pypresence` >= 4.3.0 (Discord presence)
- **[optional]** `PySDL2` >= 0.9.16 (global mouse state backend)

# Codebase Notice

The codebase currently follows the following conventions (they are not hard rules):

- `__init__` and `init(_*)` methods are called once.
- Every method starting with `ui_` is only responsible for organizing and rendering the UI components. The main `ui` function of each UI component is split in several subfunctions for ease of readibility.
- Every method starting with `action_` is almost certainly a callback that is _only_ called following a user UI interaction, and never called from anywhere else.
- Methods starting with `get_`, despite the name, are usually called within the same class to change internal states without returning anything.
- Every normal method is used internally by the class and usually by external classes to manage the states.
